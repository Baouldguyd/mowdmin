        Baptism Acts 2vs 38 Baptism is not the clause of salvation. Baptism does
        not advocate the cleansing of sins and does not provide forgiveness of
        sin.
      </p>

      <p>
        When we read Acts 2 vs 38, the term simply means because of the
        forgiveness of your sins. So it is because of forgiveness of sin we are
        baptise.
      </p>
      <p>
        The reality of forgiveness precedes the rite of baptism, of course
        baptism by immersion and not ablutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Only a sincere repentance that make a way to the forgiveness of sins,
        because it¬¥s at the consequence of the remission and forgiveness of our
        sins in Christ that we are baptized.
      </p>
      <p>
        Baptism it¬¥s an act of obedience following inevitably the conversion to
        identify salvation.
      </p>
      <p>The commitment of a good conscience towards God. 1 Peter 3v21</p>

          <p>Acts 1v 4-8</p>

          <p>
            But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon
            you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all
            Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth.
          </p>
          <p>What is the Holy Spirit?</p>
          <p>
            Holy Spirit it¬¥s not a what, but He, the 3rd person of the trinity.
            In Ezekiel chapter 36:25-27 God promise to purify His people, and
            through a new covenant (Jeremiah 31:31-34); He will give a new
            spirit and new dispositions to adore Him.
          </p>

          <p>
            1¬∞ God's promise to pour out His Spirit on all flesh is to eradicate
            the aridity of His people and bring them to spiritual flourishing.
            Acts 1 v-8
          </p>

          <p>
            2¬∞ The indwelling of His Spirit in us, is to enable us to walk in
            obedience to God and His Word.
          </p>

          <p>
            The work of the Holy Spirit is the ability He gives to men to
            accomplish the tasks for which God has destined them. This consisted
            of making the believers fit for the service that God has entrusted
            to them. Actes 1v-8
          </p>

          <p>
            3¬∞ It is the working power of the Holy Spirit that inspires
            prophecies. Joel 2 v 28, John 16 v 13.

          King David sang, praised, and danced before his GOD, and his enemies
          became barren. What your God wants for you is that you come before him
          in his temple with a shear full heart and all you have and just as you
          are with praise, the fruit of your lips. (Psalm 95:2)
        </p>
        <p style={sympo}>
          The wall of JERICHO crumbles after the children of ISRAEL glorify GOD
          and walk around the wall for 7 days.
        </p>
        <p style={sympo}>
          The people of GOD were delivered from the hands of their enemies under
          the rule of JOSAPHATTS just by singing and glorifying God. (II
          CHRONICLES 20v21-22; 26-29).
        </p>
        <p style={sympo}>
          The lame man knew how to keep his miracle by singing, dancing, jumping
          and praising his God in the temple. (Acts 3v8) PAUL and SILAS sang and
          praised God and the prison doors were broken open.
        </p>
        <p style={sympo}>
          Doors that have been closed for years will open before you when you
          can praise GOD with all your heart, soul and mind.

        King David sang, praised, and danced before his GOD, and his enemies became barren. What your God wants for you is that you come before him in his temple with a shear full heart and all you have and just as you are with praise, the fruit of your lips. (Psalm 95:2)
        </p>

         <p>
        The wall of JERICHO crumbles after the children of ISRAEL glorify GOD and walk around the wall for 7 days.
        </p>

        
        <p>
        The people of GOD were delivered from the hands of their enemies under the rule of JOSAPHATTS just by singing and glorifying God. (II CHRONICLES 20v21-22; 26-29).
        </p>

        

        <p>
        The lame man knew how to keep his miracle by singing, dancing, jumping and praising his God in the temple.
        (Acts 3v8)
        PAUL and SILAS sang and praised God and the prison doors were broken open.
        </p>

        <p>
        Doors that have been closed for years will open before you when you can praise GOD with all your heart, soul and mind.

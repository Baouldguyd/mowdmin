        <h2>Our Charitable Deeds</h2>
        <p>This involves reaching out to the needy amongst us by showing 
          love and spreading the goodnews of Jesus Christ and His Salvation.
        </p>
        <p>
        We support people with social and psychological problems. (2 Corinthians 9v9)
        </p>
        
        <p>
        No one comes to Christ and goes as He was! (For everyone who calls on the name of God will be saved "RomansÂ 10:13").
        </p>

        <p>
          Sow a seed of love today.

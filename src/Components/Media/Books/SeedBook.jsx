                <h2>The Seed of the
                    Blessing

                </h2>
                <p>
                    The healing that any man claiming the
                    name of Christian hopes for today is not
                    only that of a physical or mental illness, but
                    it is also the healing and deliverance from
                    the financial and material illness that
                    ravages all nations and which remains the
                    prerogative of the Christian world. If we
                    look at the daily life of the majority and
                    especially of the children of God, we find
                    that there is only distress and frustration
                    linked to a situation of chronic poverty,
                    absence and deprivation of material
                    blessings, lack of wealth that we hoped to
                    have. Is this situation normal? Does it
                    constitute the fatal goal of our Christian
                    destiny? Certainly not, because our
                    Christian attribute predisposes us above all
                    to blessing, consecration and fullness in all
                    areas. But for the Christian of today, it
                    seems that the way of blessing is hidden
                    from him. Discover in this book what true
